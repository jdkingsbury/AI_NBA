## NBA AI Project

The Goal of the project is to train an AI on how to grade players and show their future projections.

### To run the project you will need to have these installed:
- NBA_API
- pandas
- Scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib

It is recommended to create a virtual environment before installing packages.
Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install all necessary packages.  

I am using Postgres as the database for the project.
