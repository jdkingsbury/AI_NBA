# Notes

## How we plan to grade players

- Track players stats through the season
- Track players stats to individual teams
  - We will need to rank teams they play against
  - We will need to rank the players they are matched up against
- Players and teams play style will need to be taken into account

## Weight Differential

- Offense will outweigh defense
